# Haya-Website
## Description
This project is a static e-commerce website primarily built using HTML and CSS, with some features implemented in Javascript. The website is designed to mimic the functionality of a basic online store, allowing users to browse products, view details, add items to a cart, proceed to a checkout page, and more. While the website is static and does not store any data, it provides a realistic user experience with interactive elements like a shopping cart and form validation.

This project was a collaborative effort and the final project of our first semester course Introduction to Communication and Technology.
